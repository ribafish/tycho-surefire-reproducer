# Tycho-surefire-plugin reproducers

Each of the reproducers is set up as their own project. To test any of those, you need to run `mvn clean install` in their respective directory.

Both of these projects are based on demos available in the tycho repository available [here](https://github.com/eclipse-tycho/tycho/tree/main/demo/testing/).
